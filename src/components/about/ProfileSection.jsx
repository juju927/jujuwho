          I&apos;m <strong>Joanna</strong>, a software developer from Singapore
          ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a year in the industry, I love that I can now make (most of) the ideas in my head come to life (after a lot of procrastination). It's always one rabbit hole after another?!
        </p>
        <p>
          I love creating minimalistic web apps that contain various cute
          elements!
        </p>
        <p>Spending too much time on small details is a huge flaw of mine.</p>
        <span className="italic text-xs">
          Someday, I want to make a website with an easter egg that is more
          intricate than the site it is found in!!
        </span>
